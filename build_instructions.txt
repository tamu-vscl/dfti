Instructions for building DFTI
-------------------------------

1) Clone the dfti git repo into whatever environment you want
2) Now there are certain dependencies that are required in order to build the repo. They are listed below:

a) g++
b) cmake
c) mavlink/c_library_v1 * this is a git repo that neeeds to be cloned into /usr/include/mavlink/v1
d) gcc, for dependencies
e) qt5-default
f) qt5base-dev
g) libqt5serialport
h) libqt5core

* You can usually follow what is needed by the cmake configuration file. That should tell you if you are missing a file or a library.

3) Navigate to the home libary of the cloned repo

4) In the main directory enter:
	> cmake .
5) If there are configurations or dependencies missing you need to fix them. You can find most of them in part 2 of this guide

6) After configuration you need to run the following command to build and install the package:
> make install

7) You should get a message telling you which build you got as well as the other configurations

8) Congratulations! You just built DFTI.
